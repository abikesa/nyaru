## Hon. GAD K. GASAATURA Presents This Paper For Discussion

In the recent past, some people, led by one Mr. Frank Gashumba, proposed that Banyarwanda of Uganda, as enshrined in the Constitution, be renamed 'Abavandimwe', (meaning 'brethren', of one womb/mother). Such a move, they aver, will put an end to the discrimination, harassment and victimisation that Banyarwanda continue to be subjected to. This presumes that the cause of discrimination is due to the obvious connotation in the word 'Banyarwanda', which might seem to connect them to Rwanda. The proposal met with much bewilderment and consternation especially among Banyarwanda—both within and without the confines of Uganda. It was widely rejected.

### This article seeks to examine the issues raised in the said proposal.

**Team Gashumba presents TWO ISSUES. And I will examine them within Two perspectives - The African Context & The Global Perspective:**

#### The Main Issues Raised:
1. Many Banyarwanda of Uganda, are frustrated. Almost at every turn, they suffer much discrimination, and are treated as not being fully Ugandan; they often have to explain themselves as to why, if they are Banyarwanda, they do not want to go 'back home' - to Rwanda! Consequently, many complain of being denied Uganda Passports, jobs, promotions and other services and opportunities ordinarily available to other citizens.
   > *As I will argue, FEW BANYARWANDA WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE COMPLAINT.*

2. In view of the above, Team Gashumba proposes that Banyarwanda of Uganda be Re-named 'Abavandimwe', to avoid being mistaken for Banyarwanda of Rwanda (Rwandans).
   > *While most will agree with the problem so identified: FEW BANYARWANDA WOULD AGREE WITH THE PROPOSAL.. - to change their identity..!*

#### I will also introduce two perspectives:
3. **The AFRICAN CONTEXT** - The Legacy of Colonial Boundaries
4. **The GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE** On Ethnic Rivalry & Conflict - Are We Alone?

### TEAM GASHUMBA CONCERNS:

#### Are there Native Banyarwanda citizens of Uganda?
- Refer to Population Census records in Uganda, starting in 1911; then 1921, 1931; 1948, then 1959 - before the influx of Refugees fro Rwanda, and 1969. In all these Population Counts, Banyarwanda consistently turned out between 6% and 7% of the population, making it 6th or 7th largest ethnic group in Uganda, most of them in Buganda, Kigezi and Ankole. Needless to say, There are, indeed, BANYARWANDA of UGANDA, equal citizens with the rest, who need not explain themselves more than is reasonable or as required of others.

#### Historical Background
- As at 1893, there was no entity called Uganda. In present-day western Uganda, there were several disparate Chiefdoms and Kingdoms, such as Mpororo, Nkore, Tooro & Bunyoro, which, in peace or in war, had close relations with other neighboring kingdoms of Rwanda, Karagwe, Kooki, Buganda among others. Consequently, their respective people's would move across borders, to flee conflict or in search of opportunities.

#### Constitutional Framework
- **1962: UGANDA INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTION**
  - "Every person who, having been born in Uganda, is on 8th October 1962 a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies or a British protected person, shall become a citizen of Uganda on 9th October 1962."

- **1995: UGANDA CONSTITUTION**
  - "Every person who, on the commencement of this Constitution, is a citizen of Uganda shall continue to be such a citizen."

#### Personal Notes
- My own maternal grandfather, AZARIYA KANYAMIBWA, was present, at the Kamwezi signing of the Protocol between Great Britain and Germany, Describing the Frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and German East Africa, Signed at Kamwezi in 1911. He was also one of the Local Officials who accompanied the Enganzi (Primier) of Ankole, NUWA MBAGUTA, together with Europeans, in the demarcation of the Uganda/ Rwanda border. But my family was not alone in the border area; until 1960s, Banyarwanda made up a majority along the Rwanda border.

# PART II
## Should Banyarwanda of Uganda Change Their Name?

The proposal to rename Banyarwanda of Uganda to "Abavandimwe" has been met with significant resistance. This section elucidates why many within the community find the idea uninformed, unreasonable, and even ridiculous.

### The Uninformed Nature of the Proposal

It's evident that most individuals who discriminate against the Banyarwanda do so out of malice. Changing the name is unlikely to deter this ill will. For example, the ethnic cleansing episode of 1982 saw over 100,000 Banyarwanda expelled by the UPC Government. Among these were individuals who had assimilated into other Ugandan communities and lost their Kinyarwanda language proficiency. The harrowing experiences of these expulsions make the "name change" suggestion appear as nothing short of a bad joke.

### The Ridiculousness of the Suggestion

The Banyarwanda constitute a global community, spread across East and Central Africa and beyond. Their native language, Kinyarwanda/Kirundi, ranks among the most widely spoken languages in Africa. The culture of the Banyarwanda is deeply rooted and has enriched communities across the globe. 

#### A Case in Point: "Gushumbush' Inka"

The Banyarwanda culture compels community members to embrace "Ubuntu n' Ubupfura," meaning kindness and consideration. It is socially mandated to look out for one's neighbors, treating their needs as one's own. For example, if a community member suffers significant loss—such as losing their cattle—it becomes a community responsibility to help that individual regain their footing. This usually takes the form of loaning cattle to the person in need, to be returned when they have stabilized ("Kwitura").

### Conclusion

The strong communal ties among the Banyarwanda evoke both admiration and envy from others. The cries of, "Kwonk' Abanyarwanda Nimukundana!" ("Why do the Banyarwanda love each other so much?") echo the sentiments of many who witness the community's unity.

So, is the culture and the name "Banyarwanda" something to abandon? 

I argue, unequivocally, no.

We are the Banyarwanda;  
We are the Abavandimwe;  
We are the proud descendants of a rich heritage!

## The Legacy of Arbitrary Colonial Boundaries in Africa: A Focus on Uganda and Beyond

## Introduction

Borders often delineate more than just territories; they mark divisions in families, communities, and entire ways of life. In Africa, the consequences of arbitrary colonial borders have been far-reaching, affecting countries like Uganda profoundly. This essay delves into the sociopolitical and cultural implications of these artificially created boundaries, with examples ranging from local tribes to political figures. 

## The Partition of Africa: The Berlin Conference and Beyond

The Berlin Conference of 1884-85 epitomized colonial greed, where European powers gathered to carve Africa into pieces like a weakened buffalo preyed upon by hyenas. The legacy of this partition has had a lasting impact on African nations, including Uganda. This partition disregarded the sociocultural landscapes of Africa, often splitting families and communities apart. Although the tragedy of arbitrary borders is a pan-African experience, Uganda serves as a poignant case study for understanding these divisions.

## The Ethnic Overlap: Uganda's Shared Communities

One of the most tangible impacts of these artificial borders can be seen in the ethnic communities that now straddle two countries. In Uganda, we find tribes like the Samia, Bakusu/Bagisu, and Iteso sharing roots with communities in Kenya. These tribes are bound not by modern geopolitical lines but by common ancestry, language, and traditions. 

### A Tale of Two Ugandan Kings and Their Influence in Kenya

Cultural kings have a powerful influence that crosses these man-made borders. In a recent story published by the Daily Nation of Kenya, it was revealed that two Ugandan kings—the King of the Bamasaba and the King of the Itesos—hold substantial sway in Kenyan politics. Despite their roles being constitutionally recognized only in Uganda, their influence is so profound that they have mediated between Kenyan political leaders.

### The Awori Family: A Case Study in Trans-Border Identity

The tale of Moody Awori and Aggrey Awori perfectly encapsulates the surreal experience of families divided by borders. Moody served as Kenya's Vice President, while Aggrey held various high-ranking positions in Uganda, including Minister for ICT. Both brothers came from a family whose lineage straddled the Uganda-Kenya border, illustrating how the separation of lands has forced people to adapt multiple identities for political or social survival. 

## Stories from the Frontline: Personal Experiences

Many Ugandans have had to redefine their identities when crossing into neighboring countries. During the era of Idi Amin, some Ugandans fled to Kenya, adopting local ethnic identities to survive. These stories are not unique to Uganda; they mirror experiences across African borders,

I apologize for the abrupt cut-off. Let's continue.

## Stories from the Frontline: Personal Experiences (Continued)

... the Bakongo people in Angola to the Sotho in South Africa. They reflect the intricate tapestry of African identities that have been torn and stitched back together in a pattern dictated by colonial history.

## European Comparisons: A Different Tale

It's noteworthy that European nations like Switzerland and Belgium, with their multilingual and multi-ethnic populations, have managed to maintain a degree of stability and unity that has eluded many African countries. This contrast underscores the injustice of the arbitrary borders imposed on Africa, which ignored the complex web of languages, cultures, and tribal affiliations.

## The Southern Flank: Uganda's Relations with Neighboring Tanzania and Rwanda

Even towards the south, the colonial legacy looms large. The Karagwe people in Tanzania share cultural similarities with the people of Ankole and Kooki in Uganda. Likewise, the long history of interaction between Rwanda and Uganda has resulted in linguistic and cultural overlaps, complicated further by the arbitrary lines drawn by colonial powers. Former Rwandan President Habyarimana, for instance, was of Mukiga origin from northwestern Rwanda, highlighting the blurred lines of identity and nationality.

## Conclusion

The legacy of Africa's arbitrary colonial borders persists, not only in geopolitics but also in the social and cultural fabric of nations like Uganda. These borders have done more than just separate lands; they have divided families, ripped communities apart, and created a complex landscape of identities that people have to navigate daily. As we move further into the 21st century, addressing the repercussions of these divisions remains a challenge—one that requires acknowledging the past, understanding the complexities of the present, and striving for a more unified future.

In Uganda and beyond, the arbitrary pen of the Berlin Conference continues to write its story, but the narrative is not set in stone. It's up to the current and future generations to challenge, rewrite, and, where possible, erase these lines of division.

## Part IV: The Global Perspective on Ethnic Rivalry and Conflict

### The World at War with Itself: The Rise of Nationalist Extremism
The dissolution of the ideological struggle between the U.S. and the USSR in 1989 appeared to promise a new era of global cooperation. However, the last three decades have seen a resurgence of nationalism and ethnic conflicts, shifting the focus from superpower rivalry to localized disputes.

### Echoes of History: WWI and the Austro-Hungarian Empire
Much like the tensions between the Slovacs and the Austria-Hungarian rule that triggered WWI, ethnic and tribal animosities continue to serve as flashpoints. The emotional weight of nationalist sentiments often blinds communities to the severe consequences of conflict, both human and economic.

### A Tapestry of Struggle: Global Examples
From the plight of the Uighur Muslims in China and the Rohingya in Myanmar to the racial tensions in the United States symbolized by the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, the world is indeed aflame with tribal rage. Even in European countries like France and Germany, nationalist sentiments are leading to clashes between communities and are driving the political narrative.

### The Role of Constitutional Constructs
As Edgar Tabaro aptly points out, the incorporation of ethnic loyalties into Uganda's constitution has only served to perpetuate divisions. This is a shared issue in many countries where constitutional frameworks have not been adapted to reflect the realities of multi-ethnic societies. Rather than unifying the population, such legislation can foster resentment and provide the groundwork for conflict.

### Affirmative Action and the Ugandan Context
The lack of affirmative action policies to benefit impoverished communities, such as the Banyarwanda, has further exacerbated divisions. Tabaro’s point about the economic rise of descendants of these communities through discipline and hard work may not necessarily generate goodwill, thereby fueling resentment among other communities.

### Conclusion
In an increasingly interconnected world, the risks posed by ethnic conflicts and nationalist extremism are not confined within national borders; they have global repercussions. The challenge lies in addressing the deeply rooted ethnic divisions while fostering a sense of national and, indeed, global unity. 

The narrative of nationalism and ethnic loyalty is a potent one, and the world seems to be in a loop of historical repetition. To break this cycle, structural changes are needed—both in constitutional norms and in the social fabric of nations. While the lines drawn by history continue to dictate the stories of today, it is up to current and future generations to redefine these narratives for a more peaceful and integrated world.

And so, in Uganda, as in many other parts of the world, the task of erasing or redrawing divisive lines—be they geographical, ethnic, or ideological—remains an ongoing struggle that will define the trajectory of the 21st century.
